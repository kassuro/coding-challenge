# Kreuzfahrtberater Frontend-Challenge

This is my (partial) solution to the coding challenge from Kreuzfahrtberater.

To see the instructions for the challenge open the `project_challenge` pdf file in the root dir.

# Instructions for usage

## Set up env variables

This project needs some variables in an `.env` file. I provide an `.env.dist` file in the repo.
Just copy, rename and fill it.

## Setup

Make sure to install the dependencies:

```bash
# yarn
yarn install

# npm
npm install

# pnpm
pnpm install --shamefully-hoist
```

## Development Server

Start the development server on http://localhost:3000

```bash
npm run dev
```

## Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
npm run build
```

Locally preview production build:

```bash
npm run preview
```
